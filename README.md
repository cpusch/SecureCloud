# SecureCloud
The aim of this project is to develop a secure cloud storage application for Dropbox, Box, Google 
Drive, Office365 etc. Application will secure all files that are uploaded to the cloud, 
such  that  only  people  that  are  part  of  your  “Secure  Cloud  Storage  Group”  will  be  able  to  decrypt 
uploaded files. Any member of the group should be able to upload encrypted files to the cloud service. 
To all other users the files will be encrypted.

Had issues authenticating with a cloud service so currently the files are just being pushed to a upload/download folder. 
But implementing with a cloud provider API should be quite trivial.
